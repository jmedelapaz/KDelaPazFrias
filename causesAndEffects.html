    <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
    <p>The Philippines is an archipelago known for the abundance of natural resources in its oceans, caves, forests, mountains, and more. However, as time progresses, more and more Philippine natural resources experience massive destruction as deforestation, mining, industrial development, and waste mismanagement prevail. These human activities severely harms the environment and, in turn, affects the lives of people that live in it.</p></p> </div>

      <h2>WHY THIS HAPPENS</h2>
      <h2 style="padding-top:20px">HOW IT MANIFESTS</h2>
  </div>
    
  <div class="causeseffects" style="position:relative; top:-50px;">
      <h3>Consumption of Non-renewable Resources</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp2.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">Most of our everyday-life essentials come from non-renewable resources: fuel, oil, coal, and even some types of energy. These come from natural sources that, if totally consumed, will never be produced again in many, many generations. In the Philippines, fossil fuels are the main source of energy. Coal is mined and burned to be distributed to consumers.</p>
        </div>
      <h3 style="padding-top:20px">Global Warming</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp3.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">The burning of fossil fuels (a natural resource) releases large amounts of greenhouse gasses into the air. These gasses trap heat in our atmosphere — the reason why temperatures worldwide are rising to alarming rates. The everyday weather in the Philippines is also a manifestation of global warming.</p>
          </div>
  </div>

  <div class="causeseffects" style="position:relative; top:-50px;">
      <h3>Deforestation</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp4.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">The Philippines is one of the most severely deforested countries in the tropics. From 2001 to 2021, the country lost 7.2% of its total tree cover. Industrialized areas, especially in the cities, experience high temperatures due to the lack of plantations that help ease the heat. Many infrastructures like shopping malls are built on lands that used to be forests. 
</p>
        </div>
      <h3 style="padding-top:20px">Flooding, Landslides, and Wildlife Habitat Loss</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp5.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">As a result of deforested lands, many areas are affected by flooding — which could have been prevented by trees that absorb rainwater and reduce flood deposits. Trees that keep soil together are also gone; landslides destroy the houses of residents. In deforested mountains, wildlife declines.</p>
          </div>
  </div>

  <div class="causeseffects" style="position:relative; top:-50px;">
      <h3>Irresponsible Production and Consumption</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp6.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">Even the Philippine oceans are not safe from pollution and natural resources depletion. Life underwater is terrorized by pollution; different kinds of plastics get dumped to the rivers and to the seas, floating on the oceans. But these plastics are continuously manufactured by irresponsible corporations through packaging products, even though they know that these will end up in the ocean.
</p>
        </div>
      <h3 style="padding-top:20px">Marine Wildlife Destruction
</h3>
        <div class="subcolce">
          <img src="..\images\cafp7.png" height="250px" width="260px"/>
          <p style="right-padding:20px;">As a consequence of ocean pollution, marine wildlife suffers. Ocean litter makes some parts of the underwater toxic to and inhabitable by marine species. Garbage that sinks to the bottom of the sea reaches animals that may mistake it for food. As a result, livelihoods that rely on marine life, and are near polluted areas, decline.
